        You are an advanced entity extraction assistant. Below is some web content related to restaurants, their menus, and their ingredients using blogs or websites.
        
        **User Query**: "{user_query}"

        **Extracted Content**:
        {content_snippets}
        
        **Task**:
        1. Identify all **restaurant names** mentioned.
        2. Extract the **dishes/food items** each restaurant is associated with.
        3. Preserve semantic meaning:
           - If a restaurant is mentioned **positively** for a certain dish, highlight that.
           - If it is mentioned **negatively** (e.g., "this place does NOT have gluten-free options"), retain that information.
        4. Format the response as structured insights, using bullet points.
        5. Preserve the **source website/blog name** for each restaurant.

        **Output Format Example**:
        Source: {url}
        - **Restaurant A**: Offers gluten-free pasta, highly recommended.
        - **Restaurant B**: Popular spot, but does not offer gluten-free options.
        - **Restaurant C**: Known for vegan pizza and salads.

        **Now extract and format the response. Return only the structured insights, no extra text.**
